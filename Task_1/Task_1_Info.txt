==> Instructions to run the SQL query:
- Set up a relational database management system (MySQL) with the appropriate schema.
- Import the provided data into the corresponding tables.
- Execute the SQL query using a database client or command-line interface.

==> Assumptions:
- The database schema consists of three tables: Departments, Employees, and Salary.
- The Departments table has columns ID (department ID) and NAME (department name).
- The Employees table has columns ID (employee ID), NAME (employee name), and DEPT_ID (department ID).
- The Salary table has columns EMP_ID (employee ID), MONTH (YYYYMM format), and AMT (salary amount in USD).

==> Test Cases:

- First Test Case: Verify the top 3 departments with their average monthly salaries are correctly fetched. (In Ascending Order)
- Expected output:

DEPT_NAME  AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY (USD)
HR	          5273.6842
IT	          5839.3939
Finance	      6360.3175

- Second Test Case:  Check if the departments are listed in descending order based on average monthly salary.
- Expected output:

DEPT_NAME  AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY (USD)
Sales	      7045.1613
Ops	          6420.0000
Finance	      6360.3175
